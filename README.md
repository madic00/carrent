# carrent

This is more advanced project and pretty clean project. Architecture is like MVC model. Everything is dinamiclly fetched from database. All cars are listed to the user and he can filter and sort whoever he want. Also I implemented paging. Once user submit request to rent a car, admin can see on dashboard and approve if car is not already rented(implemented checks by date). On the profile page user can see all submit request and see the current status, also he can managed it. He can write reviews also and managed it. Admin can manage(full crud operations), in admin panel, cars, brands, see stats of page access, manage bookings & reviews.

Other functionalities: working with images, Error handling in log file, working with word and excel files, registration and log in, track of access to pages, form validation on client & server side, working with PHPMailer.
